# Bank of Dad
## Helpingn parents teach their kids to manage their money
### A Laravel/Vue mobile first web application

This is my senior project for my software engineering degree from BYU-Idaho.  I have been wanting to build this app for a couple of years now to help teach my own children with managing money.

The basic premise is Dad/Mom is the bank, kids are account holders. Whenever the kids aquire money, they have the option to deposit money in the Bank of Dad. After handing their cash over to Dad, he pockets it and does whatever he wants with it. He makes an entry in the App, and the child can see their balance in a simplified app. When ever they want to make a withdrawal or purchase, they go to dad who can check their balance and then either give them the cash, or make the purchase for them and then enters the withdrawal in the app. Dad can set a custom interest rate appropriate for the child's age (10% a week?) which automatically accrues, set up automatic withdrawals/deposits, and set up different categories for budgeting and goals.
